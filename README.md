# mongo-university-m101js
Repository to hold the sources distributed for mongodb university's m101js, as well as my associated notes and homework solutions.

Most of this source code was distributed to me by the folks over at Mongodb / Mongo University (for m101js, beginning January 2016).
The things I've written myself usually begin with "homework" or something similar, though I've also taken some notes throughout the source code provided in the form of comments.
